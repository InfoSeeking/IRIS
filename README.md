The API endpoint for IRIS is located at [iris.comminfo.rutgers.edu](http://iris.comminfo.rutgers.edu)

You can test out the API yourself or use our [request sending tool](http://iris.comminfo.rutgers.edu/tests/requester/)

You can see more about IRIS [here](http://iris.infoseeking.org)

# Directory Structure
- bin/ - Executable files (compiled on Linux Mint)
- extension/ - written in C to handle text processing, compiled version is called text_processing and is in bin folder
- controllers/ - files which perform specific tasks (e.g. clustering, summarization, etc.)
- library/ - helpful methods shared among all operators
- storage/ - folder where all of the request/response data is stored, where all of the necessary indexing files are created (and removed)
- tests/ - this folder has all of our testing XML files, most of which are very simple and used for debugging, however, under tests/higher_behavior, there are more interesting XML tests using piping to do more complex actions
- tests/requester - this is a tool for sending XML requests to your API and viewing responses in a collapsable XML tree. It is useful for testing without having to write code
- config.php - configuration for debugging and file paths
- dbconfig.php.example - configuration file for database (remove the trailing .example to use)

# Issues and Disclaimers:
- There is no user authentication implemented. As of now each request MUST HAVE the clientID element which I plan to replace with OAuth.
- As the toolkit is now, persistent documents are never deleted. This may change in the future if I make a tool to delete old and unused cached pages/indexes but at the moment it 
- If you have trouble with installation on Ubuntu Linux due to a missing "zlib.h" or other zlib file, try to run "sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev". [See this link](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1632027).

# How to Alter and Host IRIS
## Server Prerequisites and Considerations
To run IRIS, you need the following:
- Indri (I used version 5.4) binaries of IndriBuildIndex and IndriRunQuery. There are versions compiled on Linux Mint in the bin folder, however if you are running a different operating system you may need to recompile. You can find the source for Indri [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lemur/)
- The OfflineCluster binary from Lemur (only used for the cluster operator) also located [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lemur/)
- [MiniXML](http://www.msweet.org/projects.php?Z3) for C extensions (not required if you don't need to recompile the text_processing binaries)
- The text_processing binary compiled on your system. The source for this is in the extensions folder. There is an existing binary in the bin folder, and it was compiled on Linux Mint.
- PHP 5.4.6 (It probably works on other versions, but this is what is was developed on)
- MySQL (for storing request information, however, this can be removed if necessary)
- Permissions to write to storage folder

Some considerations:
- You should have roughly 300MB of storage space minimum. This covers approximately 1000 requests, responses, and pages as well as 100 indexes. This is a very rough estimate and if you intend on storing persistent requests as well as indexes more space would be advisable.
- You may want to increase the PHP maximum execution time. If you are expecting requests with a lot of URLs (not content) fetching every document may take longer than the default maximum execution time of 30 seconds. 

Once PHP and MySQL are installed on your local server you can continue setting up your MySQL database. Create a database (any name). Import the data table in the file sql\_structure.sql by using a command similar to:
'''
mysql -u<user> -p<pass> <dbname> < sql\_structure.sql
'''

Then edit the dbconfig.php.example file and update the $user, $pass, $db, (and $port if necessary) variables to match yours. Rename dbconfig.php.example to dbconfig.php.

## How the Requests are Handled
The API endpoint is the index.php file. When a client makes a request to the API, the index.php file receives this request. The request is expected to contain a variable called <b>xmldata</b> which contains all of the request XML (formats of which are described later in this documentation). When index.php receives this, it will parse the <b>xmldata</b> variable as a SimpleXML object. Using the value of the "requestType" element, it loads an operator with that value (if one exists and is specified in config.php). So if the value of requestType is "extract" then it will load the file controllers/extract.php.

## How to Add an Operator
In the file you created in the controllers directory, make a new class with the same name as the file (except with a capital letter first). This class needs to extend the Controller class. Now you can override the run method and write the code to process the request there and return the output. So going with our keywords example you should have the following:

- A file named keywords.php in the controllers directory
- In keywords.php, a class named Keywords which extends the Controller class
- In the Keywords class, a run method which contains the main processing logic

Now if you try sending a request with requestType set to "keywords" IRIS will complain and say that keywords is not a valid type. So as a last step, in config.php, add 'keywords' to the VALID_REQUEST_TYPES array. Now IRIS will know that "keywords" is a valid operator.

## How to Add a Text Processing extension
For heavy text processing, it is recommended that you write a program in C which your PHP operator can call since text processing would probably be less efficient in PHP. All of the text processing functions are contained within the "extension" directory. The text_processing.c file is the main file. To add a new 

## Error Response
When IRIS encounters an error, this is what it will return:
```
<parameters>
	<error>message</error>
</parameters>
```
#Authentication for Data Protection
IRIS is an open API and therefore we wish to make it as easy to use as possible (ideally having no registration for users). However, without registration, there is no guarantee that your data is safe. If two different clients use the same client id, they could accidently overwrite each others stored files (indexes, cached pages, etc.). To combat this, we have implemented an optional registration which authenticates clients per website (as of now). This means that registered users specify which website they will be calling IRIS from, and we give them a fixed client id. When they call the API with that client id, we check if the IP address from where they are calling matches that of the website.

However, registration is completely optional. If you do not wish to register, use any client id less than or equal to 10,000. These ids are completely open to the public and can be used on the fly. We do not suggest using this if you are planning on storing any data since the data safety is not guaranteed.

# Request and Response Format
## Some Extra Notes:

If the clientID element is unspecified, we assume a client id of 1.

You can specify IRIS not to return the content element (as this can be very large) by passing the element returnType with a value of nocontent.

There is also the option of specifying a user id to add an extra layer of page specificity. That way pages are stored per user id, so two different users could have two different pages with the same id both stored on the server

### Format of resource:
- id - unique number as specified by client, this must be unique for each page, we will use this to store in our indices and we will return the page id's
- url - optional, if the page is a webpage, we can fetch the content from a URL
- content - optional, you can specify the content (HTML or plain text) directly in the XML request

### Notes about resources:
Resources are a generalization of an entity of information. A resource can be a webpage or user specified content. A client wanting to send resources to our API will send them in a <b>resourceList</b> element with the required information described below.

For a resource, you must specify either the <b>url</b> (if it is a web page) or the <b>content</b> element with the plain text data.

<b>EDIT: Due to confusion, as of July 2nd caching has been turned off on the main hosted IRIS. A config flag has been added to turn it back on. We are discussing implications of caching and how to do it more elegantly</b>,Furthermore, resources are stored for caching if the <b>persistence</b> element is specified. If persistence is specified, then the pages will be stored on our server for caching, which can reduce response time and allow for more complicated requests (involving Indri indices). However, this means that each resource must be uniquely identified. 

Identification of a resource happens on two or three levels. The client using the API will have a client id. Each resource the client sends must include a unique <b>id</b> element. Also there is an optional user id which can be used to differentiate between users on the client's system.

On the initial call to the API, the client will have to specify either the content or URL for all of the pages passed. However, a benefit of enabling persistence on pages is that for any later calls on the same pages, the client will only need to specify the id element.

Operators which modify content (e.g. filter) will return the content element with a type attribute indicating that it has been modified. For example, calling the filter operator will return content with type="filtered". Even having persistence enabled will not store modified content.

Example request:
```
<persistence>TRUE</persistence>
<returnType>nocontent</returnType>
...
<resourceList>
	<resource>
		<id>page ID</id>
		<url>http://...</url>
	</resource>
	<resource>
		<id>page ID</id>
		<content>Some lengthy text here...</content>
	</resource>
</resourceList>

```
## Merge
Merge requests combine multiple resourceList elements into one.
### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>merge</requestType>
	<resourceLists>
		<resourceList>
			<resource>
				<id>id</id>
				<content></content>
			</resource>
			...
		</resourceList>
		<resourceList>
			<resource>
				<id>id</id>
				<content></content>
			</resource>
			...
		</resourceList>
		...
	</resourceLists>
</parameters>
```
### Response
```
<parameters>
	<requestID>number</requestID>
	<requestType>merge</requestType>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
				<id>id</id>
				<content></content>
		</resource>
		<resource>
				<id>id</id>
				<content></content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>	
</parameters>
```
## <a id="Pipe"></a>Pipe
The pipe command allows you to do a unix-like pipe feeding the output of one command into the input of another. This allows multiple commands to be easily strung together and called repeatedly without much work of the client. See the tests folder to see some example pipe requests.

Subtle Behavior:

If you pipe to rank/filter/query, and do not supply a wordlist element, it will automatically use the content of the first resource of the first resourceList in queue
###Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>pipe</requestType>
	<command>
		(Any of the input formats for the commands)
	</command>
	<command>
		(This command will get the resourceList input from the previous command, therefore it is not necessary to include a resourceList in this command.)
	</command>
	...
</parameters>
```
### Response
The response will follow the format of the last executed command.

## <a id="Limit"></a>Limit
The limit request allows you to select a subset of results. The offset is optional and defaults to 0. This is comparable to a SQL limit.
### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>limit</requestType>
	(<offset>number</offset>)
	<amount>number</amount>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```
### Response
```
<parameters>
	<requestID>number</requestID>
	<requestType>limit</requestType>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```

## <a id="Sort"></a>Sort (deprecated)
Sort a resource list
This operator uses an older format of resources (and will check for a field element). However, it will be updated to adhere to the new XML format. Until then, it is advised not to use this operator unless you wish to alter it.

### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>sort</requestType>
	<orderby type="desc|asc"> 
		field name (defaults to id)
	</orderby>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```
### Response
```
<parameters>
	<requestID>number</requestID>
	<requestType>sort</requestType>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```
## <a id="Extract"></a>Extract
Extract shows the most frequent words. It will return the number of keywords specified by <b>numWords</b>.
### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>extract</requestType>
	<numWords>number</numWords>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
			<content>
				data
			</content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```
### Response
```
<parameters>
	<requestID>number</requestID>
	<requestType>extract</requestType>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
			<keywords>
				<keyword>
					<word></word>
					<freq></freq>
				</keyword>
			</keywords>
			<content type="extracted">
				words in order of frequency
			</content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```

## <a id="Filter"></a>Filter
### Request
The filter operator removes words from the resources provided.
The wordList parameter contains the words you wish to remove from the content.

```
<parameters>
	<requestType>filter</requestType>
	<wordList>words</wordList>
	<minLength>number</minLength>
	<maxLength>number</maxLength>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
			<content></content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```
### Response
```
<parameters>
	<requestID>number</requestID>
	<requestType>filter</requestType>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
			<content type="filtered"></content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```

## <a id="Query"></a>Query
As of now, you can query documents with a set of words in the wordList element. The query checks the number of occurences of each word. You can use the following checks:

- eq - equal
- ne - not equal
- gt - greater than
- lt - less than

The useStemming flag tells whether or not to match a word based on partial beginning match. i.e. if useStemming is true and the word 'cat' is in the wordList, this will match for 'catch', or anything starting with 'cat'.

The query must be valid for each word in the wordList to return the document. (I may change this later as I feel this can be more useful)

### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>query</requestType>
	<wordList>list of words to check</wordList>
	<query>
		<type>eq|ne|lt|gt</type>
		<value>value</value>
		<useStemming>TRUE|FALSE</useStemming>
	</query>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
			<content></content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```

### Response
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>query</requestType>
	<requestID>number</requestID>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
			<content></content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```

## <a id="Rank"></a>Rank
Ranks documents based on a supplied list of words. The ranking is based on total number of occurences of the words supplied.
### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>rank</requestType>
	<wordList>list of words to check</wordList>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
			<content></content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```

## <a id="vector_rank"></a>Vector Rank
Ranks documents using a td-idf vector model of the wordList you supply and returns a rank based on the cosine similarity of the query and the document
### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>vector_rank</requestType>
	<wordList>list of words to check</wordList>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
			<content></content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```

## <a id="index_insert"></a>Index Insert
Create or add documents to an Indri index.
### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>index_insert</requestType>
	<indexID>optional</indexID>
	<persistence>TRUE|FALSE</persistence>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id></id>
			<url></url>
		</resource>
		<resource>
			<id></id>
			<url></url>
		</resource>
		<resource>
			<id></id>
			<url></url>
		</resource>
		<resource>
			<id></id>
			<url></url>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```
### Response
```
<parameters>
	<requestID>number</requestID>
	<indexID>number</indexID>
	<requestType>index_insert</requestType>
</parameters>
```
## <a id="index_delete"></a>Index Delete
Delete an Indri index.
### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>index_delete</requestType>
	<indexID>required</indexID>
</parameters>
```
### Response
```
<parameters>
	<requestID>number</requestID>
	<indexID>number</indexID>
	<requestType>index_delete</requestType>
</parameters>
```

## <a id="index_query"></a>Index Query
### Request
The query element is mostly the same as the query element describe in the Indri documentation [here](http://sourceforge.net/p/lemur/wiki/IndriRunQuery/) however, you can only specify one query at the moment.
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>index_query</requestType>
	<indexID>number</indexID>
	<query>
		indri type query
	</query>
</parameters>
```
### Response
The Indri resulting score is the logarithm of the probability, therefore the more negative the score is, the lower the rank, and vice-versa
Index Query cannot return more than the id of the pages since Indri will only return document ids
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>index_query</requestType>
	<requestID>number</requestID>
	<indexID>number</indexID>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
		 	<score>indri query score (sorted in descending order)</score>
		 	<url>page url</url>
		 </resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```


##<a id="fetch"></a>Fetch
Fetch gets the content of the passed url's. This operator is sort of a placeholder, since when a request is made (and only URLs are specified) IRIS will automatically fetch them anyway. You do not need to use a fetch before piping to another operator as it is unnecessary. However, this can be useful for fetching documents for your own use.
### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>fetch</requestType>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id></id>
			<url>page url</url>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```
### Response
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>fetch</requestType>
	<requestID>number</requestID>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id></id>
			<url>page url</url>
			<content>page content</content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```

## <a id="extract_blocks"></a>Extract Blocks
Extract blocks allows you to search for words within a specific <b>searchWindow</b> and will return the words within the <b>resultWindow</b>. For example, if you set the <b>wordList</b> to "hello goodbye" and the <b>searchWindow</b> to 5 and the <b>resultWindow</b> to 10, it will search for the the occurrences of hello and goodbye within 5 words of each other and return the surrounding 10 words.

### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>extract_blocks</requestType>
	<wordList></wordList>
	<searchWindow>num of words</searchWindow>
	<resultWindow>num of words</resultWindow>
	<useStemming>TRUE|FALSE</useStemming>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<url>page url</url>
			<content>page content</content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```

### Response
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>extract_blocks</requestType>
	<requestID>number</requestID>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<url>page url</url>
			<blockList>
				<block>
					block text
				</block>
				...
			</blockList>
			<content>page content</content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```

## <a id="summarize_sentences"></a>Summarize Sentences
This simple summarization operator will use the words in the wordList passed and deem the most important sentences of a document by which those words appear the most.

At the moment, the word list can have repeated words (which will weight those words higher). This will most likely be removed for consistency.
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>summarize_sentences</requestType>
	<numSentences>number</numSentences>
	<wordList></wordList>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
			<content></content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```
### Response
```
<parameters>
	<requestID>number</requestID>
	<requestType>summarize_sentences</requestType>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
			<content type='summarized'></content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```


## If Then
Perform a basic if-then control statement. 

The val element can be in [xpath](http://www.php.net/manual/en/simplexmlelement.xpath.php) format to access XML nodes or a literal number/string.

You can test the number of nodes returned by setting fxn to "length". You can also test for the existence of a node by using the "exists" test. Exists only requires 1 val element. Otherwise all of the other operators require 2 val elements. The nth attribute can be used to get a specific node.

The motivation behind this is for the if-then control to be used in conjunction with pipe requests to reduce total number of requests. This can be seen under examples.

### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>if_then</requestType>
	<if>
		<statement>
			<val type="xpath|literal" nth="" fxn="length">value (optional)</val>
			<test>eq|ne|lt|lte|gt|gte|exists (optional)</test>
			<val type="xpath|literal" nth="" fxn="length">value (optional)</val>
		</statement>
		<command>
			...
		</command>
	</if>
	<elif>
		(optional)
		<statement>
			...
		</statement>
		<command>
			...
		</command>
	</elif>
	<else>
		(optional)
		<command>
			...
		</command>
	</else>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<id>id</id>
			<content></content>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```
### Response
The response will be the response of the command executed from the structure OR if no command is executed (e.g. if statement is false and no else is specified) it will return the following:
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>if_then</requestType>
	<requestID></requestID>
	<status>No branch taken</status>
</parameters>
```

## Halt
The halt operator stops execution and is supposed to be used in conjunction with pipe requests and if_then requests to stop piping if certain conditions are met.
### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>halt</requestType>
</parameters>
```
### Response
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>halt</requestType>
	<requestID></requestID>
</parameters>
```

## Cluster
The cluster operator uses the OfflineCluster program provided with Lemur. This does k-means clustering. As of now, the response will only give the id's of the documents regardless of the returnType specified. This may change in the future.

### Request
```
<parameters>
	<requestType>cluster</requestType>
	<numClusters></numClusters>
	<resourceList>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```

### Response
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<parameters>
	<requestType>cluster</requestType>
	<requestID></requestID>
	<clusterList>
		<cluster>
			<clusterID>0</clusterID>
			<resourceList>
				...
			</resourceList>
		</cluster>
		<cluster>
			<clusterID>1</clusterID>
			<resourceList>
				...
			</resourceList>
		</cluster>
		...
	</clusterList>
</parameters>
```

## <a id="summarize_input"></a>Summarize Input (TO-DO)

```
<parameters>
	<requestType>summarize</requestType>
	<maxSentences>number</maxSentences>
	<individualSummaries>TRUE|FALSE</individualSummaries>
	<resourceList>
		<resource>
			<resourceID>id</resourceID>
		</resource>
		...
	</resourceList>
</parameters>
```
### Response
```
TODO
